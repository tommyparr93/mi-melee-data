# Hello!
Welcome to the GitHub of mimeleestats.com. The purpose of this project is to build a repository for all the data that is
related to the Michigan Super Smash Bros. Melee scene, and to use that data to create content and tools for the community.

The primary focus of the site in its current form is to build an accurate data set that can support our Power Rankings team
in data collection, auditing, and decision making during the conclusion of a PR season. With this new model of data collection
there will be less manpower spent on data collection and more time available to focus on cooler things.

# What data is on here, how is it collected?
The site's data is gathered from start.gg results and pulled using their API with the help of PySmashGG. The site currently 
has pulled every in-person Melee bracket since 2021 that has had over 5 entrants in Michigan. We are planning to expand this
to every tournament that an active Michigan player participates in. The core data on this site is that it tracks every single 
set played, to give a granular view of a players performance. There are also tables for tracking PR history, the different regions,
and hopefully more to come.

# What are the plans for this data?
Lots and lots of plans, go ahead and check out the project board for what we would like to see be created.

# What tools are used?
This is currently using the Django Framework in Python to handle the front and backend of this project. The database is hosted
using PostgreSQL, and the app is being run on a Ubuntu Virtual Private Server using Amazon LightSail.

# Want to contribute?
I do not intend for this to be a solo project long term. I'm looking for support from other developers within the Michigan Melee
community to make this as great as possible. I currently do not have documentation on how to get started, but if you reach out to me on discord
I'd love to talk about the project and how I can get you involved.
